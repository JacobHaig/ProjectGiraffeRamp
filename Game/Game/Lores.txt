Les was only 12 years old when 
Fire Nation had attacked and 
killed his parents and friends, 
which were a part of water tribe, 
living in outskirts of Sapa, a 
small town in East Asia. Somehow 
Les could shield himself and made 
a miraculous escape, discovering 
his new-found abilities in the 
process. Ever since that day, he 
knew that he was the chosen one, 
the only powerful enough wizard 
with the ability to cast spells 
of all four elements and that it 
was his duty to master them all, 
to defeat the Fire Lord and 
restore the peace on the continent.


Ever since the meteorite landing 
on August 16, 1615, the Fire Nation 
powers became substantially stronger. 
The Fire Nation’s Lord Zaiken 
believed in the superiority of his 
nation and set on the mission to 
take over the continent, killing 
everyone who would resist his 
authority. In a world that is 
split into four halves, a fire, 
water, wind, and earth nations, 
war rages. The ultimate fight 
between good and evil. Zaiken 
knew that there is only one person 
powerful enough to stop him, and 
it was his main goal to find 
and kill the master of all elements.
